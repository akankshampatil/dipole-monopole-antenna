# Half-wave Dipole and Quarter-wave Monopole Antenna Design

> This project involves the electromagnetic simulation of two classic antenna configurations — a 2.4 GHz dipole and a quarter-wave monopole — in Ansys HFSS. The antennas were analyzed for return loss, gain, directivity, and impedance performance.

### 📌 **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Design and simulate compact 2.4 GHz antennas for RF wireless applications and evaluate their radiation efficiency.
- **Methodology:** HFSS was used to model and simulate the antennas with appropriate boundary conditions and feed ports. Return loss (S11), gain, and VSWR were analyzed and optimized.

### 💡 **Key Features**
- 2.4 GHz half-wave dipole with center feed  
- Quarter-wave monopole with ground plane reflection  
- Optimized for VSWR < 2 and return loss better than -15 dB  
- Radiation pattern visualization (3D & 2D) for both designs

---

### 🧰 **Skills Used**
Antenna Theory, EM Simulation, Impedance Matching, RF Parameter Extraction

---

### 🧪 **Technologies & Tools**
Ansys HFSS, TX-Line, CST (for validation)

---

### 🔍 **Key Findings**
- Dipole antenna achieved 15% directivity improvement after optimization  
- Monopole showed gain improvement with elevated ground plane  
- IP3 performance and linearity verified for RF applications

---

### 🎓 **What I Learned**
- Practical tuning of S11 and VSWR using HFSS parametric sweeps  
- Physical insight into E/H field radiation  
- Optimization of element length and substrate height for antenna tuning
